✅ MULTI-METHOD CLI SETUP COMPLETE

Your project now supports 4 ways to run the same commands:

1. python3 -m src generate          (standard, works now)
2. ./run generate                   (shortest, works now)
3. python -m src generate           (after alias setup)
4. uv run python -m src generate    (after uv cache clean)

WHAT WAS FIXED:
✓ Cleared Python cache (was caching old code)
✓ Added defaults to CLI (no arguments needed)
✓ Created wrapper script (shortest commands)
✓ Created pyproject.toml (uv support)
✓ Documented all methods and issues

IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS:
1. pip install -r requirements.txt
2. export GROQ_API_KEY=your_key_here
3. python3 -m src list-vignettes    (test, no API call)
4. python3 -m src generate          (or ./run generate)
