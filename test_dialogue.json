In Imagery Rehearsal Therapy, the idea is that by reimagining and rehearsing a nightmare in a more controlled and empowering way, you can actually rewire your brain's response to the original traumatic or frightening material. Essentially, you're creating a new narrative that your brain can draw upon, rather than the old, scary one. This can help reduce the frequency and intensity of the nightmares over time. Would you like to start by identifying a specific aspect of the nightmare that you'd like to change or transform, such as the maze, the chaser, or your own actions and feelings?",
