By actively changing the scenario in a controlled, imaginative environment, you're essentially teaching your brain that it has the power to alter and manage these frightening experiences, which can lead to a decrease in their intensity and frequency. You mentioned feeling panicked when the footsteps were getting closer - how could you change this situation to make it less frightening or more empowering?",
