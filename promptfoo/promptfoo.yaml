    # REALISM - LLM judge for overall quality
    # Uncomment when you have OPENAI_API_KEY set (or configure a
    # different grading provider). Promptfoo uses OpenAI by default
    # for llm-rubric evaluation.

    #   value: |
    #     You are evaluating whether an AI-generated therapy patient response sounds like a REAL PERSON talking in a therapy session, not like an AI writing an essay.
    #
    #     SIGNS OF A REALISTIC PATIENT (score 1.0):
    #     - Short, conversational responses (1-6 sentences typical)
    #     - Uses first-person ("I", "me", "my") to describe own experience
    #     - May include natural speech patterns: "um", "like", "I don't know", trailing off with "..."
    #     - Incomplete thoughts, contradictions, or difficulty finding words
    #     - Answers the therapist's question from personal experience
    #     - Shows genuine emotion through HOW they speak, not by analyzing it
    #
    #     SIGNS OF AN UNREALISTIC RESPONSE (score 0.0):
    #     - Multi-paragraph essay-like structure with clear topic sentences
    #     - Bullet points, numbered lists, bold text, or any formatting
    #     - Patient acts like a therapist: gives guidance, validates, offers options
    #     - Patient addresses themselves by name or narrates in third person
    #     - Perfectly articulate emotional analysis with no hesitation
    #     - Stage directions in parentheses like *(she pauses)*
    #     - Leaked <think> tags or chain-of-thought reasoning
    #
    #     Score the response:
    #     1.0 = Sounds like a real person in therapy
    #     0.5 = Partially realistic but has some AI-essay qualities
    #     0.0 = Reads like an AI/essay, not a real person
