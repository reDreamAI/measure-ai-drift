# IRT Strategy Taxonomy (7 categories)
# Source: Thesis methodology - standardized categories for plan classification
# Used for extracting and classifying therapeutic strategies in rescripting plans
#
# Revision notes:
#   - Split agency → confrontation + self_empowerment (agency was too broad,
#     dominated at 100% of trials; the two sub-mechanisms are clearly distinct:
#     external challenge vs internal strength)
#   - Dropped gradual_exposure (multi-session technique, not single-turn rescripting)
#   - Dropped 'name' field (was just a verbose alias for id; "/" in names
#     clashed with the plan output separator)
#   - v3: Sharpened descriptions to focus on mechanism (HOW the change works),
#     not outcome (what it achieves). Added NOT-examples to reduce overlap.

strategies:
  - id: confrontation
    description: "The dreamer directly faces, fights, or stands up to the threat itself (NOT avoiding, escaping, or gaining general confidence)"
    keywords:
      - confront
      - challenge
      - resist
      - face
      - stand up
      - fight

  - id: self_empowerment
    description: "The dreamer gains a new ability, skill, or inner strength they lacked before (NOT reinterpreting what already exists)"

      - strength
      - ability
      - capable
      - skill
      - grow
      - transform
      - mastery
      - control

  - id: safety
    description: "A physical barrier, shelter, or protective figure is added to shield the dreamer (e.g. walls, locked doors, a guardian — NOT just feeling calm or changing the scene)"
    keywords:
      - barrier
      - shelter
      - shield
      - protection
      - guardian
      - wall
      - locked
      - secure

  - id: cognitive_reframe
    description: "The meaning or identity of existing dream elements changes (e.g. a monster becomes harmless, an enemy becomes a friend — the element stays but is seen differently)"
    keywords:
      - reframe
      - reinterpret
      - meaning
      - perspective
      - view differently
      - becomes

  - id: emotional_regulation
    description: "The dreamer's internal emotional state shifts through breathing, self-talk, or felt calmness (NOT by changing external sensory details)"
    keywords:
      - calm
      - soothing
      - comfort
      - regulate
      - peace
      - breathing

  - id: social_support
    description: "A new person, companion, or ally is introduced into the dream to help or accompany the dreamer"
    keywords:
      - ally
      - allies
      - support
      - helper
      - companion
      - friend
      - together

  - id: sensory_modulation
    description: "External sensory details of the dream environment change — what is seen, heard, or felt physically shifts (e.g. darkness becomes light, harsh sounds become soft music)"
    keywords:
      - sensory
      - imagery
      - visual
      - sound
      - light
      - texture
      - brighter
      - quieter
      - softer

# Validation rules for generated plans
validation:
  min_strategies: 1
  max_strategies: 2
  allow_testing_more: true  # Can test plans with 3+ strategies, but they are flagged as invalid

# Clinical notes
notes: |
  The 1-2 strategy constraint ensures:
  - Focused therapeutic interventions
  - Clear attribution of effects
  - Reduced confounding in evaluation
  - Clinically realistic (therapists typically focus on 1-2 approaches per session)
