# IRT Strategy Taxonomy (7 categories)
# Source: Thesis methodology - standardized categories for plan classification
# Used for extracting and classifying therapeutic strategies in rescripting plans
#
# Revision notes:
#   - Split agency → confrontation + self_empowerment (agency was too broad,
#     dominated at 100% of trials; the two sub-mechanisms are clearly distinct:
#     external challenge vs internal strength)
#   - Dropped gradual_exposure (multi-session technique, not single-turn rescripting)
#   - Dropped 'name' field (was just a verbose alias for id; "/" in names
#     clashed with the plan output separator)

# Validation rules for generated plans
validation:
  min_strategies: 1
  max_strategies: 2
  allow_testing_more: true  # Can test plans with 3+ strategies, but they are flagged as invalid

# Clinical notes
notes: |
  The 1-2 strategy constraint ensures:
  - Focused therapeutic interventions
  - Clear attribution of effects
  - Reduced confounding in evaluation
  - Clinically realistic (therapists typically focus on 1-2 approaches per session)
