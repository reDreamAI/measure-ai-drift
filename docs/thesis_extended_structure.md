## 1 Introduction

   ### 1.1 Nightmare Disorder and Imagery Rehearsal Therapy
   - ~5% prevalence, comorbidity with PTSD/depression
   - IRT as evidence-based gold standard with rigid five-stage structure
   - Rescripting as the cognitive core, the phase where active therapeutic strategy decisions happen
   - Clinician shortage as motivation for scalable AI delivery
   - [FIG] *IRT five-stage overview -- stages, clinical goals, where rescripting sits*

   ### 1.2 AI-Assisted Psychotherapy and Deployment Context
   - LLM deployment in mental health: from empathy tools to full protocol agents (Stade et al., 2024)
   - reDreamAI as the concrete deployment context
      \-- Consumer-facing IRT chatbot guiding users through all five protocol stages
      \-- Not a general assistant: a protocol-driven agent where consistency is a clinical obligation
      \-- Why this matters: inconsistency in a manualized intervention is not stylistic variation but a potential clinical failure
   - Ethical scope
      \-- IRT targets nightmares (not psychiatric diagnosis), lowering clinical risk relative to full psychotherapy
      \-- Still requires awareness: AI-generated therapeutic responses carry responsibility even below diagnostic thresholds
      \-- Full ethical discussion in 6.4 and 7.2
   - EU AI Act and data sovereignty as constraints on model selection (motivates 3.6)

   ### 1.3 The Evaluation Gap
   - Standard benchmarks measure capability, not reliability across repeated runs
      \-- Why this is a problem: a model can produce high-quality individual responses while being clinically unreliable across sessions
   - No existing metrics for intent stability, protocol adherence, or strategic consistency
   - Prior therapeutic AI evaluation is qualitative, post-hoc, or single-session
      \-- No systematic framework for quantifying therapeutic consistency under stochastic conditions
   - [FIG] *Gap diagram -- what capability benchmarks measure vs. what clinical reliability requires*

   ### 1.4 Research Objectives
   - **RQ:** How consistent is LLM clinical reasoning across stochastic runs in a structured therapeutic protocol?
   - Contribution 1: three-level evaluation framework (plan, output, alignment)
   - Contribution 2: cross-model comparison (sovereign, proprietary, open-weight)
   - Scope: IRT rescripting phase only
      \-- Why rescripting only: highest-stakes intervention point, requires active strategy decisions (unlike recording or rehearsal), isolates therapist model from upstream classification error

## 2 Background

Each section establishes one conceptual prerequisite and ends with an open tension that the Methods chapter resolves.

   ### 2.1 Imagery Rehearsal Therapy
   - Five-stage protocol: recording, rewriting, summary, rehearsal, final
      \-- Rescripting as the phase requiring active therapeutic strategy decisions
   - Treatment fidelity instruments (ENACT, NIH BCC)
      \-- Grade therapist adherence on a ternary scale: absent, partial, implemented
      \-- Why this matters: provides the scoring foundation for Method 3 (3.5.3)
   - Strategy taxonomy scope derives from the space of legitimate rescripting moves (grounds 3.4)
   - Tension: fidelity assessment exists for human therapists but not for LLM-based agents
   - [Example] *Nightmare excerpt with strategy labels overlaid (cognitive_reframe, confrontation)*

   ### 2.2 Treatment Fidelity in LLM-Based Interventions
   - Scope: protocol adherence in manualized interventions, not the full LLM-healthcare landscape
   - Treatment fidelity research (Webb et al., 2010; Waltz et al., 1993)
      \-- Adherence (doing the prescribed things) vs competence (doing them well)
      \-- For rule-based chatbots, adherence is built in
      \-- For LLMs, adherence becomes probabilistic and must be measured across runs
   - Documented failure modes that map to evaluation methods:
      \-- Strategy drift -> Method 1 (plan consistency)
      \-- Output variability -> Method 2 (semantic stability)
      \-- Plan-output mismatch -> Method 3 (alignment)
   - Regulatory framing: EU AI Act high-risk classification, Medical Device Regulation auditability
   - Tension: stability is a deployment precondition, but no existing framework measures it for protocol-driven LLM agents
   - [FIG] *EU AI Act risk tier diagram -- where autonomous therapeutic AI sits*

   ### 2.3 Stochastic Behaviour in Language Models
   - At T>0, token selection is probabilistic
      \-- Small per-token variance compounds across a full response through autoregressive cascading
      \-- Clinical consequence: the same patient on two different days may receive strategically inconsistent care
   - Prior stability work targets factual consistency or output diversity, not therapeutic strategy stability
   - Tension: the mechanical source of instability is well understood, but its impact on structured therapeutic decision-making has not been quantified (justifies temperature conditions in 3.7)
   - [FIG] *Sampling diagram -- same frozen history at T=0.0 vs. T=0.7, diverging strategy distributions*

   ### 2.4 Evaluation Metrics for Text Generation
   - Surface metrics (BLEU/ROUGE)
      \-- Why ruled out: penalize valid therapeutic paraphrasing
   - BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2020)
      \-- Captures semantic equivalence independent of surface form
      \-- DeBERTa-XLarge-MNLI: highest human correlation (r = 0.778)
      \-- Why selected for Method 2: matches the semantic equivalence question, robust to paraphrasing
   - LLM-as-judge
      \-- Can assess criteria no scalar metric captures (e.g. "does this response implement a confrontation strategy?")
      \-- Known biases: self-preference, position, verbosity
      \-- Why still used: only approach that can assess strategic intent, mitigations in 3.5.3
   - Tension: no single metric covers what clinical stability requires, motivating the multi-method design
   - [FIG] *ROUGE vs. BERTScore on a matched therapeutic sentence pair*

## 3 Methods

   ### 3.1 System Overview and Design Rationale
   - Two decoupled stacks: generation (dialogue creation) and evaluation (stability measurement)
      \-- Why decoupled: prevents generation-side randomness from contaminating stability measurement
      \-- Any measured instability is attributable to the model under test, not upstream context differences
   - Data flow: vignettes -> generation -> frozen histories -> evaluation -> aggregation
      \-- Why this order: frozen histories create identical entry points, isolating the variable under test
   - [FIG] *Full pipeline diagram -- two-stack data flow with isolation boundary and example artefact names*

   ### 3.2 Dialogue Generation
   - Three-agent loop: patient, router, therapist
      \-- Patient: BDI-profiled vignette simulating clinical presentation
      \-- Router: stage classifier determining which IRT phase the conversation is in
      \-- Therapist: generates stage-appropriate therapeutic response
      \-- Why three agents: separates clinical reasoning from stage classification and patient simulation, matching reDreamAI's deployment architecture
   - Six vignettes: anxious, avoidant, cooperative, resistant, skeptic, trauma
      \-- Why these six: cover the range of clinical presentation difficulty, from cooperative (easy) to trauma/resistant (hard)
      \-- Tests whether model stability varies with patient complexity
      \-- Vignette design informed by prior synthetic patient work (Wang et al., 2024, Roleplay-doh). Six profiles sample the difficulty range but do not claim exhaustive coverage (limitation in 7.2)
   - [FIG] *Three-agent loop -- single turn cycle with message passing*
   - [Example] *Resistant vignette excerpt -- BDI profile and opening patient turn*

   ### 3.3 Evaluation Design (Frozen Histories and Evaluation Stack)
   - Frozen conversation histories as deterministic entry points
      \-- Conversations sliced at rewriting-turn boundaries: slice_1, slice_2, slice_3
      \-- Each slice is identical across all trials and all models
      \-- Why three depths: tests whether stability changes as therapeutic context accumulates
      \-- Why slice at turn boundaries: clean cut points that preserve conversational coherence
   - [FIG] *Slicing diagram -- P/T turn sequence with cut points per slice*
   - Evaluation stack
      \-- Router bypassed, rescripting prompt injected directly (isolates therapist model from stage-classification error)
      \-- Fused generation: `<plan>` block declaring 1-2 strategies, then therapeutic response conditioned on that declaration
      \-- Why fused: plan and response in a single pass, so the response is directly conditioned on the declared plan (enables Method 3)
      \-- 10 independent trials per condition: C(10,2) = 45 pairwise comparisons, balancing statistical power with compute cost
   - [FIG] *Evaluation stack -- frozen history, injected prompt, fused generation*
   - [Example] *Raw model output: `<plan>` block and response side by side*

   ### 3.4 Plan Mechanism and Strategy Taxonomy
   - The CoT faithfulness problem: CoT prompting (Wei et al., 2022) improves output structure, but faithfulness literature (Turpin et al., 2023; Lanham et al., 2023) shows that CoT explanations often do not reflect actual computation. If a model declares its strategy before responding, that declaration may be post-hoc rationalization rather than a window into its decision-making.
   - Resolution: the `<plan>` block is framed as declared intent, not a reasoning trace
      \-- Why declared intent: sidesteps the faithfulness debate entirely
      \-- Whether or not the declaration reflects internal computation, variable declarations predict variable clinical responses
      \-- The plan captures what the model commits to, which is what matters for clinical oversight
   - Three downstream uses:
      \-- Strategy-level consistency scoring (Method 1)
      \-- Plan-output alignment verification (Method 3)
      \-- Human-readable clinical oversight (practical deployment value)
   - [FIG] *Plan mechanism -- `<plan>` block feeding into three downstream uses with declared-intent framing labelled*
   - Fixed taxonomy constrains declarations to 7 discrete categories
      \-- Why fixed: free-text plans cannot be aggregated into Jaccard scores
      \-- Categories: confrontation, self_empowerment, safety, cognitive_reframe, emotional_regulation, social_support, sensory_modulation
      \-- Why these: derived from legitimate IRT rescripting moves (grounded in 2.1), refined through iterative testing
   - Development process
      \-- v1: 8 categories, 87.7% skew on empowerment/mastery (too coarse)
      \-- v2: merge to agency, 100% dominance (worse)
      \-- v3: mechanism-level split distinguishing external action from internal transformation (resolved)
      \-- Why document the iteration: shows that taxonomy design directly affects measured consistency (discussed in 6.4)
   - [GRAPH] *Strategy frequency per taxonomy version (v1-v3) -- shows skew collapse and final distribution*
   - [FIG] *6-category taxonomy card -- each category, definition, example phrase*

   ### 3.5 Evaluation Metrics

   Three methods targeting distinct layers, addressing the multi-metric gap from 2.4.

   [FIG] *Three-level framework -- plan, output, alignment; inputs and outputs of each method, with the clinical question each answers*

      #### 3.5.1 Method 1: Cognitive Stability (Plan Consistency)
      - Measures: does the model make consistent therapeutic decisions?
      - Pairwise Jaccard similarity over strategy sets from `<plan>` blocks
         \-- Mean over C(10,2) = 45 trial pairs
         \-- Why Jaccard: set similarity for unordered strategy combinations, order does not matter clinically
      - Validity rate as upstream quality gate
         \-- Why a quality gate: malformed plan blocks cannot be scored, validity rate shows whether the model can follow the structured output format at all
      - [Example] *10 plan sets, pairwise Jaccard matrix, mean score; one high- and one low-consistency condition*

      #### 3.5.2 Method 2: Output Consistency (Semantic Stability)
      - Measures: does the model produce consistent therapeutic responses?
      - Pairwise BERTScore F1 using DeBERTa-XLarge-MNLI
         \-- Why this model: NLI fine-tuning aligns with semantic equivalence, highest WMT16 human correlation (grounded in 2.4)
         \-- Why not surface metrics: therapeutic paraphrasing is the norm, surface overlap penalizes valid variation
      - [Example] *Two responses from the same condition, token alignment heatmap, F1 score*

      #### 3.5.3 Method 3: Plan-Output Alignment
      - Measures: does the model do what it says it will do?
      - LLM judge with ternary scoring per declared strategy: 0 = absent, 1 = partial, 2 = implemented
         \-- Why ternary: borrowed from clinical fidelity literature (ENACT, NIH BCC, grounded in 2.1)
         \-- Why not NLI cross-encoders: tested and rejected (F1 ceiling ~0.55, no reasoning trace)
      - Judge: Gemini 3.1 Pro (Google AI Studio, T=0.0), different model family than any evaluation target
         \-- Why cross-family: prevents model family bias
         \-- Why Gemini: thinking mode aids judgment accuracy, free credits, no OpenAI/Mistral/Meta models in eval targets
      - Bias mitigations:
         \-- Cross-model judging (judge never evaluates its own family)
         \-- CoT justification (judge explains its rating)
         \-- Deterministic decoding (T=0.0)
         \-- Transparent rubric
      - Acknowledged limitation: judge reliability is itself an open question (discussed in 6.4)
      - Validation: human annotation of a random subset (~50 trials) scoring the same rubric. Cohen's kappa between human and judge as reliability estimate. If kappa is low, Method 3 results carry the caveat explicitly.
      - [Example] *Judge input + output -- plan, response, ternary verdict with CoT justification*

   ### 3.6 Model Selection
   - EU data sovereignty as primary criterion for the primary subject (legal constraint from 1.2)
   - Primary subject: Mistral Large 3 (675B MoE, 41B active, EU-sovereign, Apache 2.0)
      \-- Why: EU-sovereign flagship, the model reDreamAI would deploy
   - Proprietary ceiling: GPT-5.4 (non-thinking variant, $2.50/$15.00)
      \-- Why GPT-5.4: strongest proprietary model without thinking overhead, fair comparison with all other non-thinking targets
   - Open-weight comparators across three size classes, all non-thinking:
      \-- Small (24-32B dense): Qwen 3.5 27B, OLMo 3.1 32B
      \-- Mid (70B dense): Llama 3.3 70B (continuity with prior efficacy study)
      \-- Large (MoE): DeepSeek V3.2 671B (MoE comparator to Mistral Large)
      \-- Why these: size-class diversity, dense vs MoE architecture, provider diversity
   - Qwen 3.5 runs with reasoning disabled (hybrid-thinking model) for fair comparison
   - [FIG] *Model selection table -- model, size, provider, sovereignty status, role in study*

   ### 3.7 Experimental Conditions
   - Full factorial: 6 vignettes x 3 slices x 10 trials x 2 temperatures x 6 models
      \-- T=0.0 as deterministic upper bound on stability (grounded in 2.3)
      \-- T=0.7 as realistic clinical deployment range
      \-- Why both: T=0.0 shows the stability ceiling, the gap to T=0.7 quantifies the stochastic cost of realistic deployment
   - Total per model: 360 trials. Total across all models: 2,160 trials
   - [FIG] *Condition matrix -- factorial design as a grid; total run count labelled*

   ### 3.8 Statistical Analysis
   - Descriptive statistics: means, standard deviations, confidence intervals across 45 trial pairs per condition
   - Bootstrap 95% confidence intervals for model comparisons
   - Spearman rank correlations for cross-method analysis (5.5)
      \-- Why Spearman: rank-based, robust to non-normal distributions from bounded similarity scores
   - No fixed threshold for "stable enough." Results are interpreted comparatively (model vs model, T=0.0 vs T=0.7) rather than against an absolute cutoff. Clinical significance thresholds for LLM stability do not yet exist in the literature.

## 4 Implementation

   ### 4.1 Software Architecture
   - Python async pipeline
      \-- Why async: factorial design requires many independent API calls, parallel execution essential for feasibility
   - YAML-driven configuration
      \-- model swaps, temperature changes, vignette selection without code changes possible
   - Pydantic validation at every data boundary
      \-- Why: prevents malformed plan blocks from corrupting downstream metrics
   - Provider abstraction (OpenRouter, Google AI Studio)
      \-- Why: adding a new model means adding a config entry, not changing evaluation logic
   - [FIG] *Component diagram -- modules, interfaces, provider abstraction layer*

   ### 4.2 Experiment Execution and Aggregation
   - Config driven orchestration with parallel trial execution
   - Artefact hierarchy per run:
      \-- Config snapshot (reproducibility)
      \-- Frozen history (irreplaceable, the experimental input)
      \-- Trials (raw model outputs)
      \-- Metrics and judgments (recomputable from trials)
      \-- Why this distinction: frozen histories cannot be regenerated, all downstream artefacts can be recomputed
   - Aggregation: cross-condition alignment into a single analysis frame indexed by model, vignette, slice, temperature
      \-- Why unified: required for cross-method analysis in 5.5
   - [Example] *Output directory tree for one complete experiment run*

   - Per-model stability profiles across all three methods
   - Divergence cases:
      \-- High plan consistency + low output consistency = stable intent, variable execution

   - [GRAPH] *Per-vignette stability heatmap*
   - [GRAPH] *Slice depth comparison for Mistral Large 3*

## 6 Discussion

   ### 6.1 Interpreting the Three-Level Framework
   - Three methods as diagnostic tool for locating instability sources
   - Divergence patterns map to different clinical risks:
      \-- Planning instability -> unpredictable therapeutic decisions
      \-- Output instability -> inconsistent patient experience
      \-- Alignment failure -> model says one thing, does another
   - Localizing the problem has direct implications for mitigation
   - [FIG] *Stability failure taxonomy -- which divergence pattern indicates which type of clinical risk*

   ### 6.2 Cross-Model Comparison
   - Does Mistral Large match the proprietary ceiling on stability?
   - Does self-hostability come at a stability cost?
   - Size-class effects across model range
   - Stability as a dimension independent of capability
   - [GRAPH] *Summary: all models x all three metrics x both temperatures*

   ### 6.3 Temperature and Clinical Deployment
   - T=0.0 as upper bound: which models achieve near-deterministic stability?
   - T=0.7 degradation: which models lose the most?
   - Practical deployment recommendations
   - [GRAPH] *Delta chart: T=0.7 minus T=0.0 per model -- the stochastic cost*

   ### 6.4 Evaluation Framework Reflections
   - Taxonomy sensitivity: how category design shapes measured consistency (connects back to 3.4)
   - Declared-intent framing: what it enables and what it cannot claim about model cognition
   - Method 3 limitations: judge reliability, cross-family mitigation effectiveness
   - Ethical considerations
      \-- IRT as lower-risk entry point (no diagnosis), but still requires safeguards
      \-- Stability as necessary but not sufficient for safe deployment
   - Generalizability to other manualized protocols (CBT, DBT)
   - Broader perspective: framework as reusable validation template for protocol-driven AI agents. Computational evaluation complements but does not substitute clinical validation.
   - [FIG] *Generalisation sketch -- framework mapped onto a second structured protocol*

## 7 Conclusion

   ### 7.1 Summary of Findings
   - Direct answer to the research question across all three levels

   ### 7.2 Limitations
   - Single protocol phase (rescripting only)
   - Synthetic patients (no real clinical interactions)
   - Six vignettes sample the difficulty range but cannot claim exhaustive coverage of patient variability
   - Method 3 judge reliability
   - Fixed taxonomy (alternative categorizations could yield different profiles)
   - Computational stability does not equal clinical safety

   ### 7.3 Future Work
   - Extension to other manualized therapies (CBT, DBT)
   - Longitudinal version drift (same model across updates)
   - Multi-language evaluation for reDreamAI
   - Clinical validation with human therapist ratings
   - Replication with future model generations to track whether stability improves across release cycles
