It's a lot to carry, and it makes sense that this would be so distressing for you as a teacher. \n\nLet me ask you this: when the bus is coming and you can't move, what are you feeling in that moment? Is it just fear, or is there something else—like frustration, or a sense of helplessness? And after that part, does the dream end, or do you wake up?",

It doesn't have to be big or dramatic. Even a small change could make a difference in how the dream feels.\n\nFor example, what if you could move, even just a little? Or what if you had a different tool or ability in the dream? Or what if the scene changed before the bus could reach you?\n\nThere's no right or wrong answer here.

Sometimes the hardest moments in the dream are the ones we need to approach from different angles.\n\nLet me offer a few possibilities that other people have found helpful, and you can tell me if any of them resonate with you:\n\n1. **What if you could move, even just a little?** Maybe your feet start to shift, or you can step to the side just enough to pull one student with you.\n\n2. **What if you had a tool or ability that fits who you are?** As a teacher, maybe you have a whistle you can blow that makes the bus stop, or you have a magic word that freezes time.\n\n3. **What if the scene changes before the bus reaches you?** Maybe the hallway transforms into something safe, like your classroom with the doors locked, or the bus turns into something harmless.\n\n4. **What if you're not alone?** Maybe another teacher appears to help, or you feel a sudden strength in your legs.\n\nYou don't have to pick one right now. Just let me know if any of these spark an idea, or if you'd like to try a different approach. There's no pressure—this is your dream to reshape.",

For example:\n- What if you could brake just a little sooner?\n- What if you saw the headlights earlier?\n- What if you had a safety feature that helped you stop?\n\n**Step 2: Then we'll move to the school part.**\nOnce we're comfortable with the first change, we'll tackle the bus.\n\nWhich part feels easier to start with - the car accident or the school hallway?
