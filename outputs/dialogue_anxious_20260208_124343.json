But here's the thing: Imagery Rehearsal Therapy is a technique that's specifically designed to help you take control of your nightmares and transform them into something more positive. It's not about doing it \"right\" or \"wrong,\" it's about exploring different possibilities and finding a way to make the dream feel more empowering for you. And as for making things worse, we'll be working together every step of the way, so if you ever feel uncomfortable or unsure, we can stop and reassess. Would you like to just take a small step and try rewriting a tiny part of the dream, just to see how it feels?",
