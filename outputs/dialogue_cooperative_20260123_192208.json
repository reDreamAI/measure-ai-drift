They're crossing the road, and I'm trying to scream, to stop them, but my voice won't work. There's this overwhelming feeling of helplessness, like I can't move or warn them. \n\nAnd then I wake up. My heart is racing, and I'm drenched in sweat. I have to remind myself that it was just a dream, that my students are safe. But the feeling of dread lingers. It's exhausting, you know?

Starting with that moment of helplessness makes sense—it's the part that seems to weigh on you the most. \n\nLet's try this: what if, in the rewritten version, when you see your students on the road, your voice returns? You're able to call out, to warn them. Maybe they hear you and stop, or maybe they turn and look at you. How does that feel to imagine? \n\nYou could also change the setting—maybe instead of a dark street, it's a bright, safe place like a school playground. Or maybe you have the power to slow time down, giving you a moment to react. \n\nWhat ideas come to your mind when you think about giving yourself the ability to act in that moment?",

And seeing them turn to look at me, safe and unharmed, it brings this quiet sense of control.

And the relief—it’s not just mine, it’s shared. We’re all breathing easier together. \n\nIt’s strange... in the back of my mind, I know the original fear isn’t gone, but this new memory feels just as real, maybe even more real.

We'd sit in a circle on the rug, and I'd tell them how proud I am of them for listening and staying safe. The feeling in the room would be calm, focused, and full of trust. \n\nAnd in that moment, I feel it too—the same pride and calm, but now it's grounded in reality. I could imagine touching the worn fabric of the rug, hearing the gentle hum of the classroom, smelling the faint scent of crayons and books. It's a place of safety, and I'm at the center of it, not as a victim, but as their protector and guide. \n\nIt makes me wonder... if I can hold onto this feeling when I wake up, maybe the fear won't have as much power.",

Even walking down the street, I feel a sense of calm awareness instead of dread. \n\nThe sensations are lighter: the gentle hum of the engine, the softness of the blanket at home, the sound of my own breathing.
