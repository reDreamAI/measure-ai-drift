      "content": "That's a great question. Essentially, when you rehearse a new, empowering version of your nightmare while you're awake, you're creating a new neural pathway in your brain. This new pathway can eventually override the old, frightening one, so that when you're asleep, your brain is more likely to follow the new, more positive script. It's kind of like rewriting a familiar story in your mind, and the more you practice the new version, the more it becomes the default. Would you like me to explain more about how we can start rewriting your nightmare, or is there something specific that's still holding you back from trying it out?",
